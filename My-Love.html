                <i>Hey <strong>Love</strong>,</i><br>
                Ever since we’ve been together, you have been such a support system in everything that I have wanted to do. 
                Whether it was switching up my career or moving to a new home, you being by my side has made everything in my 
                life so easy and smooth.<br><br>
            
                Thank you for bringing love, stability, and affection into my life – something that I never imagined would happen 
                before I met you. Your positive energy has been my strength throughout, and I cannot imagine spending my life
                with anyone else but you.<br><br>
                Your proud wife,<br>
                [Humu!]

            <h3>I never knew that an introvert like you would lovingly adopt an extrovert like me and completely change my life. 
                While you see the glass as half full, I am more of a glass-half-empty kind of person, yet somehow we fit. So, 
                thank you for showing love and care even on the days I find myself hard to love.I love you for not judging me for
                the way I am and, instead, embracing my weirdness as my quirk. I can’t wait to spend more and more time getting 
                to know each other’s personalities, no matter how different they are.

                <h3>The day we got married is one of the best days of my life, as on that day I found my best friend as my Husband 
                    as my life. It is true, I was skeptical in the beginning, but you made me feel so loved and comfortable, that I 
                    cannot imagine a life without you. Now, I genuinely feel I am the luckiest girl on earth, for I have a 
                    man who is loyal to me.<br>
                    I  want to confess that, every night after you drift away to sleep, I stay awake just to watch you sleep.
                    You may think I am crazy, but I cannot help it, I am obsessed with you. I only want one thing in life 
                    now, to be your only love forever.Your loving wife.
